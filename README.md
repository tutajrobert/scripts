# z88

Mesh translator Salome .dat format to Z88 Aurora mesh

Just add Salome mesh file in .dat format and change mesh parameters. To do that change the code: lines from 4 to 12.

Some parts of code are commented. These are for automatic groups and boundary conditions creation. Nevertheless Z88 input files have to be very strictly written and this code often works not properly.
